# Paraphrases

Project used for generating paraphrases. It uses OPUS OpenSubtitlesv2018 for Slovene and English as source material. 
Input text files were somewhat aligned as-is from OPUS but were hand-aligned to ensure complete line matching during development. 
It uses DeepL API for translation and saves the pairs in JSON format. The pairs consist of source Slovene phrases and Slovene translations of English source phrases.
